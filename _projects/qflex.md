Computer architects have traditionally relied on software simulation to measure the performance metrics (e.g., instructions per cycle) of a proposed design. However, modern simulation requirements are challenging the conventional modeling tools that have traditionally served the architecture community. The QFlex project targets quick, accurate, and flexible simulation of multi-node computer systems proceeding along four fronts. The popular and open-source QEMU full-system emulator, which allows functional emulation of unmodified operating systems and applications. The powerful and flexible Flexus simulation framework, which allows detailed cycle-accurate simulation. The detailed and flexible NS-3 network simulation stack. The rigorous statistical SMARTS sampling theory to reduce the simulation turnaround time by several orders of magnitude, while achieving high accuracy and confidence estimates.
