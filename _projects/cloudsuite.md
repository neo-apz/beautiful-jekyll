Cloud computing is emerging as a dominant computing platform for providing scalable online services to a global client base. Today's popular online services (e.g., web search, social networking, and business analytics) are characterized by massive working sets, high degrees of parallelism, and real-time constraints. These characteristics set scale-out applications apart from desktop (SPEC), parallel (PARSEC), and traditional commercial server applications. In order to stimulate research in the field of cloud and data-centric computing, we have created CloudSuite, a benchmark suite based on real-world online services. CloudSuite covers a broad range of application categories commonly found in today's datacenters. The first release includes data analytics, data serving, media streaming, large-scale and computation-intensive tasks, web search, and web serving.
